Hi! I am Somu Prajapati, a Computer Science Undergrad from IIT Kanpur. Currently, I am a Core Engineer at Quantbox Research. Broadly, I am interested in anything tech - ranging from Randomized Algorithms to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSs). Apart from this, I am a chess fanatic and an average guitar player. I also love watching animes and talking about the philosophy of science.
