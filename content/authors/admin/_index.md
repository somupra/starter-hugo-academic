Hi! I am Somu Prajapati, a Computer Science Undergrad from IIT Kanpur. Currently, I am a Core Engineer at Quantbox Research. Broadly, I am interested in anything tech - ranging from randomized algorithms to large scale low latency distributed systems. I honed my skills in building content agnostic recommender systems and scalable APIs while working at [T0uch](https://www.t0uch.io/) and [Mobileum](https://www.mobileum.com/). Tough I am finding alignment with systems nowadays, I have always considered myself a jack of all trades, master of none - resourceful, tenacious, and a pro-googler, who is almost interested in anything.

Apart from this, I am a chess fanatic, an average guitar player, and Indian hip-hop enthusiast (binging [NAYAAB](https://open.spotify.com/album/5bRRzI1xuiNAAjdSCg5bnO?si=HrcxlQoPQ-SJfStrP_YU5A) nowadays). I also love watching animes and talking about philosophy, psychology, money, and startups.
